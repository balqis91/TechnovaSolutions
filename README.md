## 🛠️ DAX Measures  

Some DAX calculations used in Power BI:

```DAX
-- Total Employees
TotalEmployees = COUNTROWS(Employees)

-- Total Projects
TotalProjects = COUNTROWS(Projects)

-- Average Years of Service
AverageYearOfService = AVERAGE(Employees[YearsOfService])

-- Employees per Department
EmployeesPerDepartment = COUNTROWS(Employees)

-- Projects per Employee
ProjectsPerEmployee = COUNTROWS(Projects) / COUNTROWS(Employees)

-- Recently Hired Employees
RecentlyHired = CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(Employees),
    FILTER(Employees, Employees[YearsOfService] <= 2)
)
🔍 Findings
Total Employees: 50 across all departments

Total Projects: 50 active projects

Average Years of Service: 5.7 years
